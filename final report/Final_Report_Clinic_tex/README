The Harvey Mudd College Sample Thesis and Clinic Report
=======================================================

This document is meant to serve as an instructive example for
students taking Math 197 (Senior Thesis), Math 193 (Mathematics
Clinic), and other Clinic or Thesis classes at Harvey Mudd College.

This distribution consists of a number of LaTeX source files along
with several images that are used in the typeset document.  There
are two ``master'' documents -- the sample-clinic-report.tex file
and the sample-thesis-report.tex file.


Typesetting the Documents
-------------------------

You can get a typeset sample thesis or sample Clinic report by
typesetting the appropriate master document.  The
sample-clinic-report document assumes that you have a current
version of the hmcclinic LaTeX class somewhere in your TeX system's
search path.  Similarly, sample-thesis-report assumes that you have
a current version of the hmcthesis class.

If you are typesetting these documents on an HMC math Linux system,
you do not need to do anything special to obtain a copy of either
class file -- they are installed in the shared TEXMF tree.

If you are working with this document on your own machine, you will
probably want to download one or both of these classes, which
contain the class file and some support files (such as image files
of the college's logo and seal) that are used in typeset reports.

If you're at Mudd and your department doesn't have the classes
installed, please let the people running your machines know that the
classes are available and where they can find them!

The classes are available from the mathematics department's LaTeX
class page, at <http://www.math.hmc.edu/computing/support/tex/classes/>.
