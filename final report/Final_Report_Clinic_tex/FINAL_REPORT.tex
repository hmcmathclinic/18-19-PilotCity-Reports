%%% This file is part of the sample thesis document provided to HMC
%%% mathematics students.
%%%
%%% See the COPYING document, which should accompany this
%%% distribution, for information about distribution and modification
%%% of the document and its components.


%%% The top part of your document is called the preamble.  You supply
%%% some basic information about the document (such as its title and
%%% author) in a form that LaTeX can understand here.

%%% You can also load additional LaTeX packages, or style files, that
%%% affect the way that the document is laid out, typeset, or supply
%%% additional commands or environments.

%%% The preamble can also be used to define your own commands and
%%% environments, set some constants that will be used throughout your
%%% document, and so on.

%%% As you may have guessed, LaTeX's comment character is the percent
%%% sign.  Any line that starts with a % will be ignored.  You can
%%% also use the comment character to add comments to the end of a
%%% line that will be parsed by TeX.


%%% The first active line in your LaTeX document is the \documentclass
%%% command, which loads a LaTeX class file.  Class files generally
%%% define the appearance of a document, and include a variety of
%%% structural commands.

%%% Clinic reports use the clinic class, which should be located
%%% somewhere in TeX's search path.

%%% For midyear reports, include the midyear option, as in
\documentclass[mathematics,finalreport]{hmcclinic}

%%% Other packages needed by your document may be loaded here.
\usepackage{url}              % For formatting URLs and other web or
                              % file references.
\usepackage{mflogo}           % Provides the METAFONT logo.
\usepackage{booktabs}         % Publication-quality tables.
% \usepackage{natbib}           % Provides some nice citation and
                              % bibliography formatting commands.
% \bibpunct[:~]{(}{)}{;}{a}{,}{,~} % Set some defaults for bibliographic
                                 % punctuation used by natbib.sty.

%%% Information about this document.

%%% I find it most useful to put identifying information about a
%%% document near the top of the preamble.  Technically, this
%%% information must precede the \maketitle command, which often
%%% appears immediately after the beginning of the document 
%%% environment.  Placing it near the top of the document makes it
%%% easier to identify the document, and keeps it out from getting
%%% mixed up with the real meat of the document.

%%% So, some questions.

%% What is the name of the company or organization sponsoring your project?
\sponsor{PilotCity}

%% What is the title of your report?
\title{Automating an Engine to Extract Educational Priorities for Workforce City Innovation}

%% Who are the authors of the report (your team members)?  (Separate
%% names with \and.)
\author{Madison Hobbs (Project Manager) \and Jean Selasi Adedze \and Dominique Macias \and
  Xuming Liang \and Aanya Alwani}

%% What is your faculty advisor's name?  (Again, separate names with
%% \and, if necessary.)
\advisor{Dr. Talithia Williams}

%% Liaison's name or names?
\liaison{Derick Lee, PilotCity}

%% Did you have an outside consultant help you with this project?  Put
%% their names in the \consultant command.
%% \consultant{Joseph Jones}

%%% End of information section.

%%% New commands and environments.

%%% You can define your own commands and environments here.  If you
%%% have a lot of material here, you might want to consider splitting
%%% the commands and environments into a separate ``style'' file that
%%% you load with \usepackage.

\newcommand{\coolcommand}[1]{#1 is cool.} % Lets everyone know that
                                % the person or thing that you provide
                                % as the argument to the command is
                                % cool.

%%% You probably won't want any of the following commands, which are
%%% here to allow various the names of commands, make examples typeset
%%% properly, and so on.  You can, of course, use them as examples for
%%% your own user-defined commands.
                                                                               
\newcommand{\bslash}{\symbol{'134}}%backslash
\newcommand{\bsl}{{\texttt{\bslash}}}

\newcounter{cms}

%%% Some theorem-like command definitions.

%%% The \newtheorem command comes from the amsthm package.  That
%%% package is loaded by the class file.

\newtheorem{thm}{Theorem}[chapter]
\newtheorem{Theo1}{Theorem}[chapter]
\newtheorem{Theo2}{Theorem}[chapter]
\newtheorem{Lemma}{Lemma}[chapter]


%%% If you find that some words in your document are being hyphenated
%%% incorrectly, you can specify the correct hyphenation using the
%%% \hyphenation command.  Note that words are separated by
%%% whitespace, as shown below.

\hyphenation{ap-pen-dix wer-ther-i-an}
%%% The start of the document!

%% The document environment is the main environment in any LaTeX
%% document.  It contains other environments, as well as your text.

\begin{document}

%%% The front matter of a large document includes the title page or
%%% pages, tables of contents, lists of figures or tables, and so on,
%%% your abstract, a preface or introduction, and so on.  It's
%%% delineated with the \frontmatter command.
\frontmatter

%%% One of the things that the \frontmatter does is make page
%%% numbers appear as lowercase Roman numerals---i, vi, xii, and so
%%% on.

%%% The first thing in the front matter is your title page.  The title
%%% page is formatted by commands in the document class file, so you
%%% don't need to worry about what it looks like -- just putting the
%%% \maketitle command in your document (and filling in the necessary
%%% information for the identification commands above) is enough.
\maketitle


%%% Abstract

%%% Your abstract should be a \emph{brief} summary of the contents
%%% of your report.  Don't go into excruciating detail
%%% here---there's plenty of room for that later.

%%% If possible, limit your abstract to a single paragraph, as your
%%% abstract may be used in promotional materials for the Clinic.
\begin{abstract}
  Our clinic team was tasked with developing software and algorithms to automate PilotCity programming and to extract educational insights from unstructured data sources like websites, syllabi, resumes, and more. Our solutions involved creating web interfaces for PilotCity users to engage with, designing a recommender system that facilitates the process of matching employers to high school classrooms, and employing topic modeling techniques to extract educational priorities of an institution through all its syllabi. Our team also investigated the creation of an automated study guide using insights from topic models.

  In this report, we detail our approaches, implementation, results, future directions, and the impact of our work.

%%% comment out the appropriate command.

%%% End of the front matter.

%%% Beginnning of the main matter.

%% The main part of your report consists of normal, numbered
%% chapters.  The main matter is opened with the \mainmatter command.
\mainmatter


%%% Content.

%%% For smaller documents---especially those you're writing by
%%% yourself---you might write your entire report using a single LaTeX
%%% source file.  For larger documents, we recommend that you split
%%% the source file into several separate, smaller files.  The smaller
%%% files are ``included'' into your main, or ``master'' document
%%% using \include commands.

%%% Splitting your source has several advantages.  One, it allows you
%%% to have more than one person working on different parts of the
%%% document at the same time (although we still recommend that you
%%% use CVS or a similar revision-control system!).  Two, smaller
%%% document chunks allow you to reorganize your document more easily.
%%% If your decide that Chapter 8 would be better as Chapter 4, all
%%% you have to do is swap the \include commands around.  For that
%%% reason, you may want to consider giving your separate chapters
%%% meaningful names rather than calling them ``chapter1'',
%%% ``chapter2'', and so on.

%%% Finally, splitting the document allows you to concentrate on a
%%% particular section without being distracted by other
%%% sections---all you have to do is comment out the \include line for
%%% the sections you're not working on.  This technique can be
%%% especially useful when you're trying to track down a problem by
%%% allowing you to easily locate the file with the problem and
%%% rule out the other sections.

%%% In our example document, we're going to define a slew of chapters,
%%% each of which has some useful information about writing Clinic
%%% reports or using LaTeX.

%%% Back matter.

%%% The back matter of a document is where the bibliography and index
%%% are defined.  It starts, not surprisingly, with the \backmatter
%%% command. 

\backmatter


%%% Bibliography.

%%% BibTeX is the tool to use for citations and layout of your
%%% bibliography.  Instead of having to type ``[5]'' or ``(Jones,
%%% 1968)'' (and keep track of which citation is which and renumber
%%% them as you add more references to your bibilography), you use
%%% special commands that allow BibTeX and LaTeX to automatically put
%%% the correct information in the right place.

%%% Depending on your field, it may or may not be appropriate to list
%%% references for which you haven't included specific citations.  If
%%% your field sanctions such practices, or if you just want to get an
%%% idea of what you have in your bibliography file, you can include
%%% everything with the \nocite{*} command.
% \nocite{*} 


%%% The appearance of your bibliography and citations in your text are
%%% defined by a combination of any bibliography-related LaTeX
%%% packages (such as natbib, harvard, or chicago) and the particular
%%% bibliography style file that you load with the \bibliographystyle
%%% command.  Bibliography-style files end in .bst; you can find them
%%% by searching your file system using whatever tools you have for
%%% doing searches.  (On most modern Unices, ``locate .bst'' will give
%%% you an idea of what's available.)

% \bibliographystyle{plainnat}

%%% The particular bibliography data file or files that you want to
%%% use are specified with the \bibliography file.  Multiple files are
%%% separated by commas.

%%% You might want to use multiple bibliography (or ``bib'') files if
%%% you had a master bib file containing references you use again and
%%% again, and another containing only records for references for a
%%% particular project.

%%% Many people create a single, large bib file that they use for
%%% everything they write.  That approach requires you to \cite every
%%% reference that you want to use in your document -- using
%%% \nocite{*} with a huge bibliography database will give you a large
%%% bibliography containing many references you haven't consulted for
%%% your particular document!
\bibliographystyle{apacite}
% \bibliographystyle{plain}

\bibliography{bibliography}
\nocite{*}

%%% Glossary or Index.

%%% If you were going to include a glossary or index in your document,
%%% the relevant commands would appear here.

%%% If you think that you would like to include such features, talk
%%% with someone who's worked with LaTeX a lot very early in your
%%% writing process.  These commands require you to do a bit of
%%% thinking about what you would want to index or gloss in advance --
%%% going back though a completed document to add \index commands is
%%% *not fun*.
