\chapter{Acknowledgments}

Thanks to Darryl Yong, who wrote a similar document in November, 2000,
from which I borrowed some ideas.  Thanks also to Zeke Burgess, who
wrote the \file{thesis.cls} class and, presumably, the original
version of the \file{samplethesis.tex} file from which I stole some of
the mathematical examples, and Jeremy Rouse, who modified that sample
file.
